<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  Hi, I’m David John Bagtindon, an electronics engineering student with a strong interest in electronics, robotics,        <br> 
  and emerging technologies, with a growing interest in web development. I enjoy working on hands-on             <br>
  projects and system design, where I focus on problem-solving, logical thinking, and practical implementation.  <br>
</p>

<p>
  I’ve worked on academic and personal projects involving electronics, IoT, basic robotics, and web-based  <br>
  applications, which have helped me develop skills in circuit analysis, microcontrollers, programming,    <br>
  technical documentation, and modern web technologies. I’m always eager to learn, improve, and take on    <br>
  challenges that allow me to grow both technically and creatively.
</p>

<p>
  Currently, I’m seeking opportunities in internships, project collaborations, or entry-level roles where I <br>
  can contribute my skills and continue building meaningful, real-world engineering projects.               <br>
