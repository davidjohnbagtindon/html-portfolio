 <h3>
  Solo Leveling
 </h3>
 <p>
  Solo Leveling is set in a world where mysterious gates appear, releasing monsters that <br>
  threaten humanity, and only awakened humans called hunters can fight them. Among       <br>
  them is Sung Jin-Woo, known as the weakest hunter, barely surviving low-level dungeons <br>
  and constantly risking his life just to earn a living.
 </p>
<p>
  After a near-death experience in a dangerous dungeon, Jin-Woo gains access to a unique    <br>
  system that allows him to level up, gain skills, and grow stronger without limits. Unlike <br>
  other hunters whose strength is fixed, he continuously evolves, quickly surpassing        <br>
  everyone around him through relentless battles and training.                              <br>
</p>
<p>
As Jin-Woo’s power rises, he uncovers the hidden truths behind the gates, the system, and         <br> 
the forces manipulating the world. His journey transforms him from humanity’s weakest             <br>
into its strongest protector, as he faces overwhelming enemies that threaten the fate of mankind. <br>
 </p>

 <h3>
  Mercemary Enrollment
 </h3>

 <p>
  Mercenary Enrollment follows Yu Ijin, a boy who survives a plane crash and grows up as a   <br>
  child soldier and elite mercenary. After ten years, he finally returns to South Korea and  <br>
  reunites with his family, trying to live a normal life while hiding his violent past.      <br>
 </p>

 <p>
  Enrolling in a regular high school, Ijin struggles to adjust to civilian life, especially school <br> 
  politics, bullies, and social norms that feel more dangerous in a different way. Despite his     <br>
  calm and quiet demeanor, his combat skills and instincts as a mercenary quickly surface          <br>
  whenever his family or friends are threatened.
 </p>

 <p>
  The story balances intense action with family and school drama, focusing on Ijin’s efforts      <br>
  to protect the people he cares about while resisting a return to the life of violence he was    <br>
  trained for.
 </p>

 <h3>
  Magic Emperor
 </h3>

 <p>
  Magic Emperor follows Zhuo Fan, a ruthless demonic cultivator who is betrayed and killed,       <br>
  only to be reborn in the body of a weak servant boy. Retaining his past memories and            <br>
  overwhelming experience, he begins a calculated rise in a brutal cultivation world where        <br>
  power, status, and cunning determine survival.
 </p>

 <p> 
  Using intelligence, manipulation, and sheer ruthlessness rather than blind heroism,            <br>
  Zhuo Fan strengthens his body, builds influence, and elevates the declining Luo clan           <br> 
  he serves. His methods are often cruel and morally gray, setting him apart from typical        <br>
  righteous protagonists.
 </p>

 <p>
  As Zhuo Fan grows stronger, he faces powerful sects and enemies from his past life, all        <br>
  while struggling between his demonic nature and the unexpected loyalty and bonds he forms.     <br>
  The story emphasizes strategy, dominance, and the cost of absolute power.                      <br>
